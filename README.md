Rest API to detect if the DNA is from mutants or humans, it also returns the stats of all the DNAs that were validated by the API

_________________________________________________

## Use Instructions

The API have 2 endpoints:

### /mutant: 

You can call this end point with the DNA parameter, this is an array of strings, and this detects if this array is human or mutant, also this information is saved in a database in order to provide stats

- **URL:** https://api-meli-mutants-jperez.herokuapp.com/mutant

- **Method:** POST

- **Body Params:** JSON based in DNA sequence with this format:

  ```javascript
  {"dna": [[string], [string], [string], ...]}
  ```
  > **E.g Mutant:**
  {
  "dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]
  }

  > **E.g Human:**
  {
  "dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATTT","AGACGG","GCGTCA","TCACTT"]
  }

This array must be NxN. The strings only have these characters; A, T, C, G.
 
 - **Expected results:** 
  
    - 200: This is a Mutant. 
    - 403: This is a Human.
    - 400: Any error or Incorrect DNA. 
    

### /stats:

Return stats of all the DNAs that were validated by the API

- **URL:** https://api-meli-mutants-jperez.herokuapp.com/stats

- **Method:** GET

- **Response:** 

  ```javascript
  {
    "count_mutant_dna": [number],
    "count_human_dna": [number],
    "ratio": [number]
  }
  ```
